####Short Description
Useful commands and mini-hacks (hence the name "hax") commonly used in java.

Contains classes for sorting and searching algorithms, data strictures including lists and trees, useful and simplified console commands, easy GUI creation and methods related to numbers and math.  
Yes, this is essentially a re-make of the Java API. I am doing it for fun, to learn new stuff and to implement things in my own way.
